# Everything you need to know about Streaming using LangGRaph

## Why LangGraph?

LangGraph lets you structure your AI applications as a **graph of nodes**, where each node performs a specific task (e.g., calling an LLM). It helps you **track state**, maintain **memory**, and easily control the flow of conversation.

## Key Highlight — Streaming

LangGraph supports two powerful ways to stream content from your chatbot:

### `.stream()` — Stream State Updates or Final Results

* This method is used when you want to **see intermediate steps** or final output of nodes in **real time**.
* It streams high-level updates from your graph (not individual tokens).
* Useful when debugging or showing "what the agent is doing" step by step.

> Example use case: Watching each node’s output appear as the user talks to the bot.

###  `.astream_events()` — Token-by-Token Streaming with Event Metadata

* This is the **most powerful** form of streaming in LangGraph.
* It streams **individual tokens** generated by the LLM, similar to how chat apps (like ChatGPT) show responses appearing word-by-word.
* It also includes detailed event metadata:

  * What node generated it
  * Whether it’s the start, middle, or end of a node execution
  * Any intermediate content (e.g., LLM tokens)

> Example use case: Live response streaming in a chatbot frontend or UI.

##  How Streaming Helps

| Feature                          | `.stream()`                   | `.astream_events()`                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Level of detail                  | High-level (states/results)   | Fine-grained (tokens + metadata)   |
| Useful for                       | Debugging, flow visualization | Real-time typing effect, async UIs |
| Supports                         | Step-by-step execution        | Full event lifecycle               |
| Event metadata (node info, etc.) | ❌ Not included                | ✅ Fully included                   |
| Typical output                   | Final answer chunks           | Per-token + node activity events   |


##  Streaming Use Cases

*  **Real-time conversations** — show responses as they're typed out
*  **Monitoring** — see exactly how the model moves through nodes
*  **Fine control** — customize behavior based on token-level insights
*  **Experimentation** — perfect for debugging LLM behavior inside your pipeline

## When to Use Which

* Use `.stream()` if you just want **quick feedback** from your graph’s logic (like logs or stage-by-stage results).
* Use `.astream_events()` when building anything **interactive**, like a **chat UI**, **voice assistant**, or **live dashboard**.

## Summary

LangGraph's streaming features turn your chatbot from a simple question-answer tool into a **responsive, traceable, and flexible AI system**. Whether you're debugging or building for users, streaming lets you **see and control** how your bot thinks — in real time.
